				<h2>Backstory</h2>
				<p class="three-col">
					At the age of 5 Colresh's family moved to the town of Brownsburg. It was there that his father, Barold, found employment as a blacksmith's apprentice for several years. Eventually Barold inherited the smithy from his master took on apprentices of his own. During this time Colresh would often be found working his way through the many caves and forests that dotted the hills near Brownsburg. As he matured he took a liking to books of learning, inspiring him to search for truth and reason in all things. He took a particular interest in the motivations of the people around him. At the age of 20, a group of mercenaries kidnapped a prominent political figure, who was visiting Brownsburg. Using his excellent skills of perception and insight, he was able to track down the mercenaries and recover the prominent political figure. Since then Colresh has travelled from town to town serving as both an investigator and political ally.
