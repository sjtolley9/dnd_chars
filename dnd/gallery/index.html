                <hr />
                <p class="center"><span class="quote">A role-playing game (RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting.</span><br /> - Wikipedia, Role-playing game</p>
                <p class="large">RPGs allow players the opportunity to participate in a shared narrative that occurs in a fictional world. In most games one player acts as a game master, who dictates how the narrative proceeds based on the rules of play and the actions of the other player. In other games, all players work together to develop the narrative, much like improvisational theatre.</p>
                <p class="large">Dungeons & Dragons, created by Gary Gygax and David Arneseon and widely considered to be the first tabletop RPG, was released in 1974 by TSR Inc. Within the next few years several other RPGs were released by different compnaies. Some provided a fantasy setting like Dungeons and Dragons, while others provided rules for science fiction or super hero adventures.</p>

                <h3>A Brief History of Role-Playing Games</h3>
                <hr />
                Tabletop Role-Playing Games, such as Dungeons & Dragons, first got their start in the mid-1970s. Dungeons & Dragons,
                released in 1974, is widely considered to be the first tabletop RPG.

                <hr />
                <p class="large">Because its inclusion elements such as magic spells, demons, and devils, Dungeons and Dragons received a great
                    deal of criticism beginning in the early 1980s. 
                    "Concerns peaked when the suicides of two troubled players of the game — James Dallas Egbert in August 1989 and Irvin "Bink" Pulling in June 1982—were blamed on D&D." 
                    Claims began to arise that D&D and other RPGs were promoting suicides, murders, witchcraft and Satanism. (The Satanic Panic and Dungeons & Dragons: A Twenty-Five-Year Restrospective)

                <h3>New Impressions</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>After the moral panic of the 1880s and 1890s began to subside, tabletop roleplaying games fell out of the public spotlight. However in 2015 RPGs, more specifically Dungeons & Dragons made a comeback the eyes of the public. The first factor for this resurgence is likely due to the release of a new Dungeons & Dragons ruleset in 2014.
                    This new edition of D&D was designed to make the rules simpler than past editions, making it more accessible to new player.
                    Another factor that brought more attention to D&D was that some groups began streaming their games on internet platforms. One of the most popular of these streams was Critical Role, which featured a group of voice actors playing D&D. Because of the story driven nature of role-playing games,
                    the audience of these streams require little knowledge of the game rules to enjoy the stories. Other creators on the internet share D&D stories, some of which provide illustrations or animations as well.
                </p>
                <p>In July of 2016, Netflix premiered their original show Stranger Things. Dungeons & Dragons plays a central role in the plot, serving as a shared pastime of the shows protagonists.</p>
