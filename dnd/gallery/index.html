                <hr />
                <p class="center"><span class="quote">A role-playing game (RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting.</span><br /> - Wikipedia, Role-playing game</p>
                <p class="large">RPGs allow players the opportunity to participate in a shared narrative that occurs in a fictional world. In most games one player acts as a <strong>game master</strong>, who dictates how the narrative proceeds based on the rules of play and the actions of the other player. In other games, all players work together to develop the narrative, much like improvisational theatre.</p>
